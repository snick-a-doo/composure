Meson looks for a pkg-config file for Csound.  There's one in the project root in case
there's not one on the system.

mkdir build
meson setup --pkg-config-path=. build

To run

cd build
./play ../midi.csd
timidity out.midi --force-program=1

On my system, program 1, 8, 12, 45 are good.
1 - Piano
8 - Vibraphone or marimba
12 - Vibraphone or marimba
45 - Pizzicato
